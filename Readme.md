Working on typescript...
<br>
Tried out some string concatenations that print in the console. 
<br>
I added a clickable button to the html that prints how many times it has been clicked. 
I'm using math in the form of an increment function. 
<br>
The page will always list the current date. 
<br>
I created an array that prints out a list of words. And another array that randomized the numbers in the array. 
<br>
I've tried commenting throughout the code. I still struggle with avoiding the 'null' error. I have to read upon that. :/
But I used an if statement to check for null.
