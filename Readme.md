Typescript:
<br>
In this typescript project I have practised doing things like string manipulation, DOM manipulation, date formatting, event handling, creating an object and array manipulation. 

- Tried out some string interpolation `${}` to concatenate strings.  
- I output the date at the top of the site. 
- I added a clickable button to the html that prints how many times it has been clicked.  
- I'm using math in the form of an 'increment' function. 
- I created an array with multiple outputs. First one prints out a list of words. And the second array randomized the numbers in the array, and in the randomizer I used a 'math' method. 
- The 'for' loop shows programmatic access to array items. 
- I used 'if' statements to check for true/false
- Created an empty object and added properties to that object. 


- I ran into a whole lot of errors on the way and I don't fully grasp the typescript concept. Some fixes are not great but to save time and get on with other projects I'll leave it as is. I'll get back to this when I have time to redo properly.
