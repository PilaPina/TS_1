            <p><b>JAVASCRIPT NOTES:</b> <br> <b>Double or single quotes?</b>
                You have a couple of options for your specified output. <br> You can use the escape character \ for the quotes that need to be printed, and are the same as the outer quotes: <br>
                <span>console.log("It's a \"moot\" point.");</span> <br>
                //Or <br>
                <span>console.log('It\'s a "moot" point.'); </span> <br>
                Or you can use the back tick to enclose both single and double quotes: <br>
                <span>console.log(`It's a "moot" point.`);</span></p>
                <p><b>Some concepts:</b> <br>Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log(). <br>
                We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */. <br>
                There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object. <br>
                Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879 <br>
                Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String' <br>
                The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.   <br>
                Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
                Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase(). <br>
                We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.  <br>
                Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.</p>
